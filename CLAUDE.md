## What This Product Does

Takes a Suno or Udio song and turns it into a music-curious non-musician's first guitar lesson — automatically.

Upload AI song → get key (plain English) → get 3–5 chords (large finger diagrams) → play along in sync → get pointed to the right JustinGuitar / Marty Music lesson.

**Core principle: "Your AI song as your first music lesson."**

**The magic trick:** a song that sounds complex is usually 4 chords. The product reveals that simplicity in a way that feels like a revelation, not a disappointment. "Your song in 4 chords" is the hero moment.

The user is a non-musician. They do not know what a chord progression is. They do not know what Chordify is. They are motivated because it is their song. Design everything for that person.

## Current Build State

### ✅ Built and Working
- MIDI parsing (`midi.py`) — tempo, time sig, note extraction
- Key detection (`analysis.py`) — music21 analyzer
- Gesture classifier (`analysis.py`) — melody / dyad / strum / arpeggio classification
- Chord inference by measure (`analysis.py`)
- Chord simplification (`simplify.py`) — extensions, enharmonics, slash chords
- Capo suggestion (`simplify.py`) — frets 1–7, guitar-friendly keys
- MusicXML export (`export.py`) — gesture-aware: notes, dyads, slash noteheads; treble clef forced
- CLI (`cli.py`) — Typer, --simplify/--no-simplify, --inspect, rich console output
- Audio transcription (`audio.py`) — Basic Pitch → temp MIDI → pipeline
- Pitch range filter (`analysis.py`) — strips overtones outside E2–E5 (MIDI 40–76)
- Arpeggio detection — sequential fingerpicked notes collapse into chord symbol + arpeggio mark
- FastAPI backend (`main.py`) — `/health` and `/upload` endpoints, accepts audio/MIDI, returns chord chart JSON
- Web UI (`frontend/index.html`) — drag-and-drop upload, loading state with time expectation copy, key + capo + scales display
- "Your song in X chords" hero section — top 6 chords by frequency with pure SVG finger diagrams (~30 chord shapes in `CHORD_SHAPES` lookup)
- SVG chord diagram renderer (`buildChordSvg()` in `frontend/index.html`) — no external library; handles open strings, muted strings, barre chords
- Bar-by-bar chord grid — full progression below hero section
- Chord timestamps in pipeline output (`time_seconds` per chord, wired up ready for playback sync)
- Railway deployment config — `Procfile` + `railway.toml` committed; app binds to `0.0.0.0:$PORT`, healthcheck at `/health`
- Railway deployed and live at `ai-leadsheet-production.up.railway.app` — requires `NIXPACKS_PYTHON_VERSION=3.11` env var in Railway dashboard
- ONNX runtime backend (`onnxruntime`) — replaces TFLite for cross-platform Basic Pitch inference on Railway (Linux x86_64)
- Python 3.11 (upgraded from 3.9 for onnxruntime compatibility)
- Diminished chord simplification (`simplify.py`) — `dim` → minor, `dim7` → `m7`
- YouTube URL ingestion (`/upload-url`) — yt-dlp downloads audio server-side; IFrame Player API syncs chords in browser
- Education layer — static `LESSON_LOOKUP` table (20 chords → JustinGuitar + Marty Music); `renderLessons()` in `frontend/index.html`
- librosa chromagram chord detector (`leadsheet/chord_detector.py`) — default audio path; Basic Pitch fallback via `CHORD_DETECTOR=basic_pitch` env var
- Feature flag `FEATURES.youtubeUrl` in `frontend/index.html` — set `false` for V1 launch (YouTube tab hidden); flip to `true` to re-enable
- Above-the-fold layout — SVG diagrams + chord cards sized to fit with audio player at 1280×800 without scrolling
- Email capture modal — 10s delay after results render; `POST /api/subscribe` → Resend Audiences API via `resend` Python SDK (env vars `RESEND_API_KEY` + `RESEND_AUDIENCE_ID`); once-per-device via localStorage (`emailCaptured` key)
- Rate limiting — `slowapi` 10 req/hour per IP on `/upload`; returns 429 with user-friendly message
- Upload hardening — 20MB size limit (HTTP 413); MIME type validation via `filetype` magic bytes (HTTP 415)
- SoloAct rebrand — all "ai-leadsheet" references replaced with "SoloAct" in UI; domain soloact.app
- Contact footer — `info@soloact.app` + Privacy policy + Terms links on every page
- Privacy policy (`frontend/privacy.html`) — GDPR-compliant; covers email-only collection, Resend as processor, consent basis, right to erasure, localStorage note
- Terms of use (`frontend/terms.html`) — covers no-warranty on transcription accuracy, user content responsibility, rate limits, limitation of liability
- Explicit `/privacy` and `/terms` FastAPI routes — `FileResponse` routes added before `app.mount()` (Starlette `StaticFiles(html=True)` does NOT auto-serve `.html` for extensionless paths)
- Playback scroll fix — `highlightChordAt()` uses container-scoped `scrollTop` on `#chord-grid` instead of `scrollIntoView` (which caused full-page viewport scroll away from hero diagrams)
- Landing page entice layer — hero headline "Your AI song. Your first guitar lesson." + 3-column feature strip (Chord diagrams / Play along / Learn) above upload box; strip hides when results show, reappears on reset
- **Chord detector quality pass (Phase 4)** — three improvements to `leadsheet/chord_detector.py`:
  1. **HPSS** (`librosa.effects.hpss`) strips drum transients before chromagram; beat tracking retains full signal
  2. **Chroma normalization** (`librosa.util.normalize`) clamps near-zero frames so quiet passages don't produce noisy matches
  3. **Diatonic key bias** — detected key's diatonic chords get +0.06 cosine score bonus to resolve major/minor ambiguity (e.g. F vs Fm)
  4. **Temporal smoothing** (`_smooth_chords`) replaces isolated single-bar anomalies with neighbour chord
  5. **Two-pass first-chord key correction** — bias-free first pass detects chords; first chord passed to `_detect_key()` which scans top-8 K-S candidates for one whose tonic matches; resolves the relative-key false-positive bug (K-S returning "F major" for songs in A minor) that caused Gm hallucinations

### 🔄 Active Development
- Suno API integration exploration (user requested — not yet started)
- Phase 4 chord quality: further validation on diverse real-world uploads needed

### ❌ Not Started (Future Phases)
- PDF export (Phase 7)
- Accounts/auth (Phase 5)
- Payment/paywall (Phase 6)
- `--for guitar|piano` CLI flag (future phase — guitar only for V1)
- Melody tabs / fretboard mapper (Phase 8)
- Piano voicings / piano chord diagrams (later phase — guitar is V1 instrument)
- URL paste input for mobile (desktop-first for V1, mobile capture layer later)

## Known Issues

- **Processing speed:** Basic Pitch takes 20–30 seconds for a full track. Workaround under evaluation: process first 60 seconds for fast initial result, full track in background.
- **Progress indicator:** ~~No loading state.~~ Resolved in Issue #6 — loading copy now reads "Transcribing your track… This usually takes 20–40 seconds. Hold tight."
- **Chord chart noise:** ~~Full bar-by-bar chart is overwhelming.~~ Resolved in Issue #6 — hero section now shows top 6 chords by frequency; bar chart is secondary.
- **Diminished chords:** ~~F#dim, Adim, Bdim appearing in output.~~ Resolved — `simplify.py` now collapses `dim` → minor, `dim7` → `m7`.

## Input Strategy — Audio is Primary

**Audio is the primary V1 input path.** MIDI is supported and produces cleaner output, but requires a paid Suno plan (Pro ~$10/month). Audio export is available to all free-tier users — a significantly larger audience.

**Hero flow:** Suno/Udio free user exports MP3 → uploads to web UI → gets key + chord diagrams → presses play → follows chords in sync → gets pointed to JustinGuitar lesson.

**Audio quality findings (from testing):**
- Suno/Udio synthesized audio transcribes well — chord progressions correct, gestures clean
- Live acoustic guitar recordings are harder: overtones, tuning variance, chord-melody bleed
- These issues are specific to live recordings, not the primary use case

**MIDI as premium path:** Supports users on paid Suno plans who want cleaner output. Worth keeping, not the lead product story.

---

## The Core Product Loop (Keep This In Mind Always)

1. **Upload** — user drops in their Suno/Udio MP3 or WAV
2. **Understand** — key shown with plain-English explanation; 3–5 chords as large finger diagrams; "Your song in 4 chords" is the hero moment
3. **Play along** — chords highlight in sync with audio; no theory knowledge required to follow
4. **Learn** — curated JustinGuitar / Marty Music videos mapped to the chords detected in their song

Step 3 is the "aha" moment. Step 4 is the retention mechanism.

**The first 15 minutes determine everything.** The product lives or dies on this window.

**Atomic acceptance tests for V1:**
- User drops in Suno song → in under 10 seconds understands: key, 3–5 chords, where to put fingers for chord 1
- User presses play → follows highlighted chord names without any theory knowledge → feels like "I'm playing my song"
- After first play-through, user knows exactly one thing they learned (e.g. "this shape is G")

## Current Session Scope

**Before starting any session, the user will specify what we're working on.**
If no scope is given, ask: "What are we working on today?" before touching any code.

Do not expand scope beyond what is stated for the session.

## Architectural Decisions (Resolved)

### Platform: Desktop-First for V1
**Decision:** Desktop-first web app for V1. Mobile is a capture layer only.

**Rationale:** The core learning moment — guitar in hand, following chord sync — happens on desktop with a big screen. Mobile is where discovery happens (user generates a Suno track, wants to save it for later).

**V1 implementation:**
- Desktop: full experience — file upload, chord diagrams, play-along sync, lesson links
- Mobile: URL paste input only — user pastes their Suno/Udio share link or YouTube URL, chart is saved and waiting on desktop. No full feature parity required in V1.

**File upload vs URL input:**
- Desktop: file upload (MP3/WAV drag and drop) — natural workflow
- Mobile: URL paste (Suno share link, Udio link, YouTube URL) — avoids awkward mobile file upload

---

### Education Layer: Curated Lookup Table (Not Live API)
**Decision:** Build a static chord-to-lesson lookup table for V1. No live YouTube API calls yet.

**Rationale:** Faster to build, more reliable, editorial control over quality. Scale to live API later when lesson library needs to grow.

**V1 implementation:**
- Curate the 20 most common beginner chords: Am, G, C, D, E, Em, F, A, Bm, Dm, E7, A7, D7, G7, Cadd9, Dsus2, Esus4, Fmaj7, Cmaj7, B7
- For each chord: best JustinGuitar video + best Marty Music video
- Detected chords → lookup → surface 2–3 relevant videos in UI
- YouTube embeds via YouTube Data API (read-only, API key only — no OAuth required)

**Why no OAuth for YouTube:**
- Surfacing lesson videos = read-only YouTube Data API = API key only, no user login needed
- OAuth only needed if writing to user's account — not required
- Suno/Udio are closed ecosystems with no public API — URL paste is the only integration path

**Future:** Swap static lookup for live YouTube API search once chord coverage needs to scale beyond the 20 core chords.

---

## Deployment & Integration Notes

- **Resend SDK required** — `urllib.request` to `api.resend.com` gets 403 (Cloudflare error 1010 = IP blocked). Always use the `resend` Python SDK (`resend.Contacts.create()`), never raw HTTP.
- **Resend API key scope** — must be Full access (not Sending-only) to write to Audiences.
- **StaticFiles html=True does not serve `.html` for extensionless paths** — `/privacy` will NOT find `privacy.html` automatically. Add explicit `@app.get()` routes returning `FileResponse` before `app.mount()`.
- **`scrollIntoView` scrolls the page viewport** — use container-scoped `element.scrollTop` instead when you only want scroll within a bounded `overflow-y: auto` container.
- **yt-dlp on Railway** — set `YOUTUBE_COOKIES_B64` env var (base64-encoded cookies.txt); locally falls back to `cookiesfrombrowser: ("chrome",)`.
- **K-S key detection relative-key bug** — Krumhansl-Schmuckler profiles cannot distinguish relative major/minor pairs from chroma alone (e.g. "F major" scores 0.76 vs "A minor" 0.63 for an Am G F C song). Fix: two-pass detection — first pass gets raw chords; first chord is passed to `_detect_key()` which scans top-8 candidates for one whose tonic matches. Songs almost always start on the tonic.
- **HPSS must use full signal for beat tracking** — `librosa.effects.hpss()` removes drum transients; `librosa.beat.beat_track()` relies on those transients. Always run beat tracking on the original `y`, not `y_harmonic`.

---

## Hard Rules — Never Do These

- ❌ Do not add drum or bass output
- ❌ Do not add piano voicings or piano chord diagrams until explicitly instructed (planned for later phase, not V1)
- ❌ Do not add accounts, auth, or payment logic until Phase 5
- ❌ Do not add PDF export until Phase 7
- ❌ Do not install new dependencies without asking first
- ❌ Do not rename or restructure files without asking
- ❌ Do not rewrite working modules to "improve" them unless asked
- ❌ Do not expand audio.py without explicit instruction
- ❌ Do not add features that expose complexity to non-musicians — if it would confuse a first-time user, it belongs in Phase 2+

---

## Code Quality Standards

- All functions must have docstrings
- New modules need a brief comment at the top explaining their role
- Don't use magic numbers — name constants
- Errors should print a clear message to the terminal, not just raise silently
- Commit after each logical unit of work with a clear commit message

---

## CLI Interface Reference

```bash
# Basic usage
uv run python -m leadsheet.cli generate song.mid --out chart.xml

# With simplification disabled
uv run python -m leadsheet.cli generate song.mid --out chart.xml --no-simplify

# Expected terminal output
Loading MIDI: song.mid
Detected Key: E major
Chord progression: E | A | B | C#m
Exported: chart.xml
```

## V1 Success Criteria (Definition of Done)

**Primary metric:** % of new users who complete one full play-through of their own song and engage with at least one chord.

V1 is complete when ALL of these are true:
1. User uploads Suno/Udio audio → receives key + chords in under 10 seconds
2. Chord display is immediately readable by someone who has never played guitar (large diagrams, no jargon)
3. Audio plays back with chords highlighting in sync — no theory knowledge required
4. At least one contextual lesson link (JustinGuitar / Marty) surfaced based on detected chords
5. Validated on 5–10 real Suno/Udio exports across different genres
6. Demo video posted to r/SunoAI — generates genuine comments, not just upvotes

**Early KPIs:**
- Activation: % who upload a second song within 7 days
- Learning: % who answer 1–2 simple in-app chord recognition questions correctly
- Revenue: conversion to paid after at least one "I'm actually playing" moment

## Roadmap Reference (Do Not Build Ahead)

| Phase | Focus | Status |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | CLI engine. Audio/MIDI in, MusicXML out. Simplification. Arpeggio detection. | ✅ Done |
| 2 | Web UI shell. FastAPI backend. Upload → key + chords displayed in browser. Large chord diagrams, plain-English key explanation. | ✅ Done |
| 3 | Playback sync. Chords highlight in real time during audio playback. | ✅ Done |
| 3b | Education layer. Surface contextual JustinGuitar / Marty Music YouTube lessons based on detected chords. Retention mechanism — do not defer past Phase 3. | ✅ Done |
| 4 | Chord quality improvements. Essentia/Demucs pipeline evaluation. | 🔄 Active |
| 5 | User accounts + chart storage. Auth. Saved charts dashboard. | Not started |
| 6 | Monetisation. Stripe. Free/paid tier. ~$5–10/month. | Not started |
| 7 | PDF export. Formatting polish. | Not started |
| 8 | Melody tabs (fretboard mapper). Post-validation only. | Not started |

---

## Phase 3 Rendering Stack (Decided, Partially Built)

- **Chord chart** — rendered in browser from JSON output (bar-by-bar chord symbols) ✅
- **Key display** — plain-English explanation + capo tip rendering ✅
- **Chord diagrams** — pure SVG renderer built in `frontend/index.html`; `CHORD_SHAPES` lookup + `buildChordSvg()` ✅
- **Hero section** — "Your song in X chords" with top chords by frequency ✅
- **Playback sync** — Web Audio API reads playback position, highlights current chord block based on `time_seconds` timestamps — next to build (Phase 3)
- **Web architecture** — FastAPI (Python) on Railway handles the pipeline; browser renders display. Server stays pure Python. ✅
- **Melody tabs** — deferred. Requires fretboard mapper. Add post-V1 only if user demand signals it.

---

## Primary User (Keep This in Mind When Making Decisions)

**The Music-Curious Non-Musician**
- Uses Suno/Udio to generate songs they genuinely love
- Has never played guitar (or gave up years ago)
- Motivated to learn for the first time because it is their song
- Does not know what a chord progression is
- Does not know what Chordify is
- Will churn fast if the first 15 minutes do not deliver a genuine "I'm doing it" moment
- Does NOT need: transcription accuracy, stems, MIDI editing, complex controls

**Design rule — enforce this always:** If a feature makes a total non-musician feel dumb, it belongs in Phase 2+, not V1.
